                I am a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. I served for 4 honorable years. 
                I am currently 34 years old. I moved to Tacoma in July of 2019 to find the next step on 
                this path we call life. I am also an aspiring developer.

                This journey of finding out I want to be a developer began around 2012 when I was working as a marekting director. I began tinkering with a few pages here and there. 
                Later, in 2014, I started my own company. It was a live online binary options trading company. I had a mutual friend build our first website,
                but after being completely dissatisfied with the results, I built our second itteration myself. Truth be told, I did use a CMS,
                but I used a basic template and built the rest of of the site from there. I was pretty proud of it actually. It had several pages
                on the public facing side, as well as a protected membership side of the site on a subdomain with several pages of content, resources, etc. I ran this company successfully for 2 years 
                before the laws changed and we decided to close the site.

                Development isn't my only passion. I enjoy a good walk through nature. Some call that hiking, but I don't require it to be a big workout to enjoy nature.
                I also love sports. I don't get into them quite as much as I did when I was younger, but I still enjoy watching "my teams".
                I find joy in using wood, cement, and other mediums to express creativity. This can be as simple as a set of coasters, a cutting board, etc
                to coffee tables, shelves, stools, and other furniture or decorations. I think it is great to be able to have a physical outlet as well as a digital one.
                I would also love to get my pilot's licence someday.

                I became a vegetarian about 2 years ago. I tried going vegan almost 4 years ago. I actually did really well with it for a few months, 
                but I had NO idea what I was doing, so I wasn't getting enough nutrients. So after 6 months of research and keeping some foods phased out,
                I finally cut out my last bit of meat and haven't looked back. I feel better than I ever have in my entire life. With that said, I am of course an animal lover. 
                I have had cats, dogs, hamsters, birds, fish, turtles, you name it as a pet before. I would love to one day have a place with plenty of land and have a safe place 
                for all sorts of animals, including llamas. First of all, they look cool. Seondly, that word is just fun to say.
